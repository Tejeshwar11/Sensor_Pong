Sonar-Ping: Luminous Abyss

A stylized, atmosphere-driven 2D platformer built with Vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas. Navigate through absolute darkness using high-intensity bio-acoustic sensors.

🕹️ Game Premise

The facility is in total sensory lockdown. You are a bio-luminescent drone equipped with an advanced sonar suite. Every surface is invisible until your sonar waves bounce off them. Your goal is to navigate the abyss, collect data shards, and reach the Yellow Pulse Portal.

🚀 Features

Luminous Art Style: Smooth radial glows, painterly fog effects, and reactive bioluminescence.

Dynamic Sonar Mechanics: High-intensity sensors that briefly reveal the environment.

Competitive Difficulty Curve: - Sector 1: Absolute introductory level with a wide path and no hazards.

Sector 2: Vertical practice zone.

Sector 3+: Introduction of moving platforms and deadly red hazards.

Advanced Movement: Kinetic dashing that ignores gravity for short bursts.

Global Leaderboard: Sync your progress to the cloud and compete for the deepest sector reached.

Procedural Audio: Real-time synthesized sci-fi sound effects and ambient binaural hums.

⌨️ Controls

WASD / Arrows: Movement & Jumping.

Space / F / K: Trigger High-Intensity Sonar Pulse (25% Stamina).

Shift: Kinetic Dash (45% Stamina).

Jump: Triggers a free, low-range proximity ping.

🛠️ Technical Details

Rendering: 2D Canvas API with procedural background generation.

Backend: Firebase Firestore for anonymous authentication and leaderboard syncing.

Audio: Web Audio API for procedural sound synthesis (no external assets required).
